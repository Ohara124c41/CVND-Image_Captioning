    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The CNN-RNN architecture framework was chosen to be an encoder-decoder. The encoder-decoder framework is essentially able to translate an image into a sentence. Normally, this is completed with two RNNs, but the CNN adaptation allows image pre-processing for better object detection and recognition by producing detailed representations input images via embedding them into a fixed-length vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RNN uses Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) which is useful for producing captions. The LSTM generates one word at every time-step conditioned on a context vector, with the previously hidden state and previously generated words. This combination of CNN-RNN is known as the Neural Image Caption model (NIC). \n",
    "\n",
    "According to experiments completed by Vinyals et al., the resulting values were also used for this model. This includes `embed_size = 256`, `hidden_size = 512` and a `vocab_threshold = 5`. The `batch_size` was chosen to be 128, which was chosen from previous work in the RSEND and CVND, as it leads to better results than batch sizes of 32 or 64. The `num_epochs` was set to three, so the network could send the images through multiple times in order to properly classify images with a high accuracy and confidence level. \n",

    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The default values in the `transform_train` were sufficient for the model. The `Resize(256)` is generally a requirement for most neural networks (including AlexNet and GoogLeNet), since images must be of the size and shape 256x256 pixels. Note that some networks allow other input dimensions, but images may undergo \"squishing\", which introduces aberrations and distortions if the image is stretched or squished.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data augmentation parameters (`random_crop` and `random_flip`) are typical for training networks. The `random_flip` feature essentially considers that images should be distinguishable from multiple rotations and even mirrored views. (occasionally images are flipped and kept, which allows for multiple images to be produced from a single image). Cropping is a technique that generally allows for the background contributions (negative space) to be reduced, allowing for an image to contain proportionally more relevant data and features than an image shot under normal conditions (centered, with the background in the image for depth and context). However, it should be self-evident that this can introduce challenges that lead to misclassification if important features are omitted. Upon analysis of the COCO dataset, it seemed that these parameters would not need to be changed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the normalization values were also unchanged. These default values are commonly used for pre-trained models. Due to the fact that training three epochs might take up to eight hours, it was better to use validated parameter values instead of tinkering too much at the cost of valuable GPU time (using the Tesla K80 Accelerator). \n",
    "\n",
    "[Data Augmentation](https://fxfactory.com/downloads/docs/noiseindustries/fxfactorypro/Documentation/distort/randomcrop.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** As given in Task#3 above, `params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters())` \n",
    "Since the project utilized a pre-trained model, the default trainable parameter values and types were unchanged. In fact, for proper compiling, the values and types must (generally) remain the same, save for the weights in the embedding layer. Ultimately, it is a good selection as it has been proven effective in numerous experiments where researches used both theory and experimental parameter tuning while observing the resulting outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Adam was chosen, as it has been proved to be very effective for stochastic optimizations. AdaGrad was also considered. Adam utilizes a step-size (usually step-down) in training the learning rate, whereas AdaGrad decreases the \"effective learning rate\" over time. In previous projects, Adam has been shown to be faster at completing the training phases (though not as fast as SGD, and occasionally not as effective). The other benefit from using Adam is not much attention is needed for the learning rate, as the step-down policy automatically takes care of everything. \n",

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",

    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
